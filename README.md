# show-notice-or-message-on-admin-area
Manual fork of WP plugin "Show notice or message on admin area" to enable dismiss notices by user.

## Replaced by a brand new plugin on WP.org repo! ##

I decided to create a brand new plugin called *KJM Admin Notices* to manage custom Admin Notices. My needs was to be able to display notices to targeted users roles and of course, enable them to permanently dismiss a notice after it’s read. And being able to keep track of which notices has been made.

It’s available now on WP.org here if you want to give a try: https://wordpress.org/plugins/kjm-admin-notices/

This is a tool to help WP websites management, so I added some cool functions like Send Email, Show/hide Notices titles and full-HTML support, possibility to activate comments, add tags, choose one of the 4 built-in WP admin notices colors. To keep track of the context when a notice was sent, some installation infos are kept alongside with the notice, eg: installed plugins list and versions, installed theme and version, etc.

### Based on the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate 3! ###

KJM Admin Notices is proudly based on the excellent *WordPress Plugin Boilerplate 3 (WPPB)*. You can find the WPPB repository here: https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate
